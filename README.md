# MY PACKAGE MANAGEMENT FILES  

![alt text](packages.png "Package Management on My Macbook Pro")

## Overview
I like to have some control to the chaos of installing different packages and libraries on my Macbook Pro.  These are the files I use to keep things in order.

### BrewFile
I use homebrew to manage various casks and software I need.

Within the directory where the Brewfile resides, run the following command

```shell
brew bundle install
```

### Gemfile
To manage my Gem dependencies I use RVM which is typical.  However, having a Gemfile to replicate my Gems across development machines is a nice thing to have :)

Within the directory where the Gemfile resides, run the following command

```shell
bundler install
```
